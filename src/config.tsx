			<p>Hi!ðŸ‘‹</p><br></br>
			<p>
			   I'm <span className="highlighted">Adam Amira</span>,  a passionate Computer Science student from Laval University. With a strong foundation in programming and system management, I thrive in dynamic environments where innovation drives excellence. My academic journey and hands-on projects have equipped me with the technical expertise and collaborative spirit necessary to tackle complex challenges.
			</p>
			<p>
			Currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I've acquired advanced skills in programming languages like Python and C++, alongside a deep understanding of object-oriented design. One of my key projects involved developing a robust software tool for federal election management, where I enhanced my problem-solving abilities and teamwork.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			My curiosity for the latest technological advancements fuels my drive to explore areas like artificial intelligence and secure, high-performance application development. I'm constantly refining my skills to integrate innovative solutions into real-world scenarios.
			</p><br></br>
			<p>
			    Here's a list of some of the technologies I've been working with recently 
			   (it's only from my public repos, so it's not exhaustive  ):
